# wrapped-justified
Wrap text to WIDTH and fully justifies the lines. 

## Usage
- Edit MAIN routine to set Paragraph and Width
- Run ```python wrapped-justified.py```

## Example 1
- P = "This is a sample text but a complicated problem to be solved, so we are adding more text to see that it actually works."
- width = 20

```
python wrapped-justified.py
 
Array [1] = "This  is  a   sample"
Array [2] = "text      but      a"
Array [3] = "complicated  problem"
Array [4] = "to be solved, so  we"
Array [5] = "are adding more text"
Array [6] = "to   see   that   it"
Array [7] = "actually      works."
```

## Example 2
- P = "Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must first decide on an argument and a working thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow."
- width = 30

```
Array [1] = "Before  you   can   begin   to"
Array [2] = "determine what the composition"
Array [3] = "of a particular paragraph will"
Array [4] = "be, you must first  decide  on"
Array [5] = "an  argument  and  a   working"
Array [6] = "thesis  statement   for   your"
Array [7] = "paper.  What   is   the   most"
Array [8] = "important idea  that  you  are"
Array [9] = "trying  to  convey   to   your"
Array [10] = "reader?  The  information   in"
Array [11] = "each paragraph must be related"
Array [12] = "to that idea. In other  words,"
Array [13] = "your paragraphs should  remind"
Array [14] = "your reader that  there  is  a"
Array [15] = "recurrent relationship between"
Array [16] = "your    thesis     and     the"
Array [17] = "information in each paragraph."
Array [18] = "A  working  thesis   functions"
Array [19] = "like a seed  from  which  your"
Array [20] = "paper, and  your  ideas,  will"
Array [21] = "grow.                         "
```
